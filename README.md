# Course

This is a repository to store all code developed during the course on Udemy called: 

> [React & Django Full Stack: web app, backend API, mobile apps](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-django-full-stack/)

This is a course that aims to learn the basics of a React front-end project using Django as an API for backend.

Even though I already have some experience with Django as a full stack framework, I thought it would be useful to do
this kinda basic course for reminding some of the basics, and also to learn how to setup a Django API and even learn 
the basics of React. 

As everytime I worked with Django I used the Django templates to generate the front-end, I didn't know the
structure of a Django API.
